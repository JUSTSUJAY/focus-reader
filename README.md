# Focus Reader

A minimalist Chrome Extension for **distraction-free speed reading** using RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation).

## Why I Built This

I often struggle with focus when reading long articles. I noticed that I read faster and retain more when words are shown **one at a time** in rapid succession—like in speed-reading videos. Existing tools had cluttered UIs or showed sliding text, which defeated the purpose.

Focus Reader solves this by displaying **one word at a time** on a **blank screen**, keeping you completely focused.

## What It Does

- **Extract & Read**: Automatically extracts the main content from any webpage
- **RSVP Display**: Shows one word at a time, centered on a dark screen
- **Smart Pacing**: Pauses slightly longer on punctuation for natural rhythm
- **Full Control**: Adjust speed, pause, skip forward/backward with keyboard shortcuts


## Installation

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `focus-reader` folder

## Usage

1. Visit any article or webpage
2. Click the **Focus Reader** extension icon
3. The reader opens in **paused** mode showing the first word
4. Press **Space** to start reading
